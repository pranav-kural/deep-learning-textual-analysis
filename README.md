# Deep Learning Applied to Textual Data

In this notebook we will perform a classification empirical study using real textual data. The intention of this project is to present a comparative analysis of the performance of a supervised learning model (in our case **Logistic Regression**) and a deep learning model (in our case a **Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier**) in the task of multi-class classification of airline passenger reviews.

Besides a detailed comparison of the performance of different types of models, we will also compare the changes in performance when using hyperparameter tuning and when using different types of preprocessed datasets.
